  html_mainText:
    "Hi, I'm Chase Seltzner, an aspiring web developer and amateur photographer. I received my Bachelor's of Science in Biology and Economics at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and my love of learning an endless amount of new ideas eventually led me into the field of web development. My love of nature led me to pick up my first real camera in early 2022, and I have not stopped snapping since.",

  html_secondaryText:
    "All of the photographs on my site were taken with my one and only FujiFilm X-T30 II. Most the images were taken using a Fuji 55-200mm, 18-55mm, or the lovely 27mm. I shoot almost exclusively in JPEG with the Astia film simulation, and perform very minor edits to exposure and contrast in Lightroom or Darktable. As a newer photographer I prefer the experience of getting the shot right in camera and minimizing the amount of post-processing needed, which is why FujiFilm is the perfect fit for me.",

    "I wanted to create this site to get more experience with the fullstack development process, and the related technologies. My goal for this site was to get more experience with the Postgres, Express, React/NextJS, and TailwindCSS stack. I am also using Cloudinary as a CDN for my uploaded photos. Beyond those frameworks, my philosophy with this site was to use as few non-security related libraries as possible, which means that all of the styling and animation on this site is custom, as well as the basic server and client side logic.",
  html_tertiaryTextPar2:
    "This site's design was inspired from various photographer's sites as well as some very clean WordPress sites, but ultimately all styling was custom created by me with TailwindCSS. I want to credit Heroicons for their wonderful free icons, and all of the animals who stood still while I was taking photos of them.",
